## Files

A2_Robotics.docx is our report. It give details on how the robot takes the data and uses it to auto drive. Additionally, the report describes the differences between driving a robot in the Gazebo physics simulator and the real world.

Database.csv is the training data we created. We made this by recording the robot driving one loop around the track. We performed data augmentation by reversing half the data so the robot would have data on driving in the other direction.

Line-follower.py contains the CNN we fed our data into.
